# MY BASH SCRIPTS
These are some bash-scripts I've written and which I want to share and to have always access from anywhere.
Some of them are made for integration in Linux Mint starters/taskbars, etc, to provide a one-click action to do something. Also integratable in other distros.
 
## DESCRIPTION

__'bashrc_git_promt.txt'__
Description to show git branches in your commandline promt

__'doOnServer.sh'__
Execute any command on your remote server

__'rbuild.sh'__
Run your make targets on a remote machine to avoid license hick-hack!

__'yt-loader-script.sh'__
A script which runs youtube-dl to get youtube stuff. The main purpose for this
is to provide a easy mechanism to download music and videos from youtube on Linux Mint by integrating
it into your menu, as a starter on your desktop or in your taskbar. As this is a normal bash script 
it can be integrated whereever you want. 
Dependencies: youtube-dl, zenity, xclip, gksudo (gksu if lower than Ubuntu 18.04) or pkexec (policykit-1 if Ubuntu 18.04 and higher).
Feel free to modify it.

__'BTconnect.sh'__
Connect to a Bluetooth device from bash script. Also for integration in Linux Mint taskbar, etc.

__'HDSleep.sh'__
Set HDD Drives to sleep after some time. (When the are to loud! :D) 

__'switchOffServer.sh'__
I used this to switch of my NAS without login into it everytime. I've also integrated it as a starter in Linux Mint.

__'wakeupServer.sh'__
Wakup my NAS with 'wakeonlan'. I've also integrated it as a starter in Linux Mint.
